thoughts:
dispach.on is useful only for d3 compenents. Our d3 specific things are: invert, remove, filter, and reordering columns.
The state for the other parts can be managed through control panel functions manipulating the url.
If we can get the .on functions to call control functions. >>>>
Step 1, make control panel functions do url stuff.
^I can either reload every time or not. For large datasets this could suck So I'll try not doing that at first 
Reset needs to set all values to default
Step 2, get url to effect control panel stuff.
Have the history.push() thing only happen on button clicks and not initialization too (probably)
Step 3, add column controls to control panel
Step 4, add .on functions that connect D3 interactions to Control panel events.
